# WhatsApp Webhook Debug Guide

## Issue: Phone messages not received

### Possible Causes:

1. **Webhook URL not properly configured in Meta Business Manager**
   - URL: `https://04b918f8-1324-429a-8c64-ebdefef53c64-00-2atotxxaug2tv.worf.replit.dev/webhook/whatsapp`
   - Verify token: `whatsapp_labs_verify_2025`

2. **Phone number subscription**
   - The WhatsApp Business phone number must be subscribed to webhook events
   - Check that "messages" field is subscribed in Meta Business Manager

3. **Phone number format**
   - Messages from your phone might have a different format than expected
   - Added extensive logging to catch any incoming webhook calls

4. **Meta Business Account Configuration**
   - Ensure the webhook is properly linked to your WhatsApp Business Account
   - Check that the phone number ID matches

### Testing Steps:

1. **Manual webhook test** - Send test payload to webhook endpoint
2. **Check server logs** - Look for any incoming webhook calls
3. **Verify Meta configuration** - Double-check all settings in Meta Business Manager

### Server Logging Enhanced:
- Now logs all webhook requests with full headers and body
- Shows detailed processing of each message
- Will catch any webhook calls even if they don't match expected format
