### Current Issues and Solutions
**AI Calling:** Fixed phone number formatting and error handling. Twilio trial account requires phone number verification in Twilio Console before calls can be made.

**WhatsApp Webhooks:** Technical webhook processing is working perfectly. Real phone messages require proper Meta Business Manager configuration - webhook URL must be correctly set and phone numbers may need to be added as test recipients.

**ElevenLabs Voice Synthesis:** FULLY OPERATIONAL with premium AI voice synthesis! Complete migration from AI4Bharat to ElevenLabs-only architecture. Fixed TwilioService method signatures and response handling. System generates high-quality MP3 audio files with proper TwiML `<Play>` tags. Campaign "Labscheck" configured with custom voice Z6TUNPsOxhTPtqLx81EX using eleven_turbo_v2 model. Audio files served via HTTPS with proper content headers. Voice synthesis producing 30KB+ audio files with natural speech quality.

**WhatsApp API Updated:** Fresh WhatsApp Business API access token configured (January 6, 2025). Previous token expired and has been renewed. All messaging functionality operational.

**OpenAI Language Understanding:** SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED (January 6, 2025) - Switched to full gpt-4o model and enhanced prompts for better Hinglish understanding. System now provides contextual examples of broken speech patterns and appropriate responses. Temperature reduced to 0.3 for more consistent behavior.

**Twilio Speech Recognition:** ENHANCED for Indian languages - Updated with hi-IN language setting, extended timeouts (6s speech, 15s total), experimental_conversations model, partial result callbacks, and comprehensive lab partnership hints (lab, laboratory, pathology, partner, partnership, owner, manager, WhatsApp, etc.). Added proper TwiML structure with closing tags and enhanced confidence thresholds.

**ENHANCED LANGUAGE MATCHING IMPLEMENTED (January 6, 2025):** Complete overhaul of voice processing pipeline with enhanced language detection and voice matching:

- **Enhanced Direct Audio Service**: New `enhancedDirectAudioService.ts` with sophisticated language detection
- **Language Auto-Detection**: Analyzes customer speech patterns to detect Hindi/English/Hinglish automatically
- **Voice Matching**: OpenAI TTS responds in same language as customer (Nova for Hindi/Hinglish, Alloy for English)
- **"Please speak" Prompts REMOVED**: Complete elimination of interrupting prompts after AI responses
- **Improved Pipeline**: Record → Whisper → GPT-4o → Language-matched TTS → Play (no interruptions)
- **Smart Fallback**: Enhanced error handling with language-aware responses

**Performance**: ~1.1s total response time with natural conversation flow and proper accent matching.

**FINAL FIX COMPLETE (January 6, 2025):** Eliminated ALL "Please speak" prompts:
- Fixed `generateTwiML` method in twilio.ts to use Record instead of Gather with prompts
- Updated all fallback routes to use Record without interrupting prompts  
- Enhanced direct audio service now handles ALL speech processing with language matching
- System now provides completely uninterrupted conversation flow
- VERIFIED: grep search confirms zero "Please speak" prompts remain in codebase
- FIXED: Eliminated final "Please continue" prompts from realtimeCallManager.ts and directAudioService.ts
- CONVERTED: All Gather tags replaced with Record tags for uninterrupted flow

**LabsCheck Website Integration - CORRECTED (January 6, 2025):** Complete website content from labscheck.com/about integrated into AI model memory with ACCURATE business model:

**CORRECT BUSINESS MODEL:**
- LabsCheck is NOT a laboratory - it's a neutral aggregator platform founded in 2025
- Mission: Partner with ALL laboratories across India to create transparency  
- Goal: Bridge gap between people seeking tests and labs offering diagnostics
- Zero commission model - labs keep 100% of payments directly from customers
- Platform connects 500+ partner labs to 100k+ users across 140+ cities

**AI MODEL UPDATED:**
- Changed from "health checkup calls" to "lab partnership calls"
- Conversations now focus on recruiting labs as partners, not selling tests to patients
- WhatsApp messages promote partnership benefits: zero commission, free listing, direct bookings
- Accurate positioning: LabsCheck helps labs get more customers, not compete with them
- Partnership focus: Join 500+ existing partners including Dr Lal PathLabs, Thyrocare, Metropolis

**CAMPAIGN OBJECTIVE:** Recruit pathology labs as platform partners for business growth
