### Current Issues and Solutions
**AI Calling:** Fixed phone number formatting and error handling. Twilio trial account requires phone number verification in Twilio Console before calls can be made.

**WhatsApp Webhooks:** Technical webhook processing is working perfectly. Real phone messages require proper Meta Business Manager configuration - webhook URL must be correctly set and phone numbers may need to be added as test recipients.

**ElevenLabs Voice Synthesis:** FULLY OPERATIONAL with premium AI voice synthesis! Complete migration from AI4Bharat to ElevenLabs-only architecture. Fixed TwilioService method signatures and response handling. System generates high-quality MP3 audio files with proper TwiML `<Play>` tags. Campaign "Labscheck" configured with custom voice Z6TUNPsOxhTPtqLx81EX using eleven_turbo_v2 model. Audio files served via HTTPS with proper content headers. Voice synthesis producing 30KB+ audio files with natural speech quality.

**WhatsApp API Updated:** Fresh WhatsApp Business API access token configured (January 6, 2025). Previous token expired and has been renewed. All messaging functionality operational.

**OpenAI Language Understanding:** SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED (January 6, 2025) - Switched to full gpt-4o model and enhanced prompts for better Hinglish understanding. System now provides contextual examples of broken speech patterns and appropriate responses. Temperature reduced to 0.3 for more consistent behavior.

**Twilio Speech Recognition:** OPTIMIZED for Indian languages - Enhanced with hi-IN language setting, extended timeouts (4s speech, 12s total), and comprehensive hints including common Hindi-English mixed terms (kya, theek, accha, matlab, etc.).

**Ready for Testing:** All core functionality working with enhanced language understanding and comprehensive LabsCheck knowledge base. System now better processes unclear/mixed Hindi-English speech from Indian customers.
